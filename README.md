# Bulk ATAC-seq Processing Workflow
## VERSION 1

* Shalini to add pipeline image *

This workflow provides an end-to-end ATACseq analysis pipeline for cell-lines, PDO, PDX and Patient Tissue samples, customized for the HPC4Health Slurm cluster.
It integrates widely used bioinformatics tools with cluster-optimized execution. 

Workflow largely follows ENCODE recomendations with scripts written by Shalini Bahl and Ankita Nand.
Layout is inspired by the following repo: UHN-PMLB/RNAseq_PDX_PDO_PatientTissue_Snakemake_v202509.
